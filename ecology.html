    <h2>Giant sequoias in the UK: a short history</h2>
    <p>
Giant sequoias (Sequoiadendron giganteum) are not native to the UK. Their natural range is restricted to the western slopes of California’s Sierra Nevada, where they grow in scattered groves at moderate elevations. Despite this narrow origin, they have proven remarkably adaptable — and the UK has played an important role in their story outside North America.

The first giant sequoias were introduced to Britain in the mid-19th century, shortly after the species became widely known to European botanists. Seeds reached the UK in the 1850s, during a period of intense interest in exotic trees and “tree collecting”. The timing was fortuitous: Britain’s cool, moist climate turned out to be very well suited to young sequoias, allowing them to grow quickly and with relatively little stress compared to hotter or drier parts of Europe.

<h2>From Victorian estates to modern landscapes</h2>
<p> 
Many of the UK’s oldest giant sequoias were planted on Victorian estates, arboreta, and large gardens, often as statement trees intended to impress. Landowners were captivated by their immense size, longevity, and novelty, and sequoias became symbols of global exploration and scientific curiosity. Some of these early plantings — now over 150 years old — still stand today and are among the largest trees in Britain by volume.

Over time, sequoias spread beyond private estates into public parks, botanic gardens, cemeteries, and institutional grounds. While they rarely reach the extreme sizes seen in California, UK-grown specimens can still become massive, long-lived trees. Today, giant sequoias are valued not only as historic plantings, but also as living experiments in how long-lived, climate-resilient trees perform far from their native range — a question that feels increasingly relevant in a changing climate.
